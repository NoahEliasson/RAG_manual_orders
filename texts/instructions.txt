First, gather all necessary components and tools. The main components you will need are a computer case, a power supply unit (PSU), a motherboard, a central processing unit (CPU), a CPU cooler, memory (RAM), a storage drive (either SSD or HDD or both), a graphics processing unit (GPU) if your CPU does not have integrated graphics or if you want better performance, and optionally additional cooling fans. The tools you will need primarily include a Phillips-head screwdriver, thermal paste (though many CPU coolers come with it pre-applied), an anti-static wrist strap or a method to ground yourself, and optionally cable ties for managing cables.

Before starting, work on a clean, static-free surface. It's best to work on a large, flat table and avoid working on carpet. If you have an anti-static wrist strap, attach it to your wrist and connect it to an unpainted metal part of your case or a grounded object to prevent electrostatic discharge from damaging components.

Begin by preparing the case. Remove both side panels of the computer case to allow access to the interior. Set the case upright with the open side facing you. Remove any packaging, internal brackets, or cabling temporarily to give yourself more working space. If the case has a removable motherboard tray or drive cages, take them out if that makes installation easier. Make sure you locate all screws, standoffs, and accessories that came with the case.

Next, install the power supply unit. Most modern cases have a compartment at the bottom rear for the PSU, but in older or different form factor cases, it may go at the top. Orient the PSU so that the fan is facing a vent (either down or up depending on airflow). Slide the PSU into the case’s PSU bay and align it with the screw holes. Secure it in place using the screws that came with it. Leave the power cables hanging loosely for now; you will connect them later.

Now it’s time to prepare the motherboard. Place the motherboard on a non-conductive surface like its anti-static bag or the foam it came with. Open the CPU socket latch, which usually involves pushing down a lever and pulling it sideways and up. Carefully remove the CPU from its packaging, holding it only by the edges. Align the CPU with the socket—there will be indicators like a small golden triangle on one corner that matches with the socket corner. Gently place the CPU into the socket without force; it should sit flat. Once it's in place, lower the latch back into place and secure it.

Install the CPU cooler next. If your cooler has pre-applied thermal paste, you can go ahead and mount it; otherwise, apply a pea-sized amount of thermal paste to the center of the CPU. Mount the cooler according to its instructions. This usually involves lining up brackets or screws with the holes on the motherboard and tightening them down evenly. If your cooler has a fan, plug it into the CPU fan header on the motherboard, typically labeled "CPU_FAN."

After the CPU cooler is installed, install the RAM. Find the RAM slots on the motherboard. They usually have two or four slots. If you have two RAM sticks and four slots, consult the motherboard manual to see which two slots to use (usually it's slot 2 and 4 or 1 and 3 for dual channel). Push down the clips at the end of the RAM slots. Line up the notch on the RAM stick with the key in the slot and push down firmly until both clips click into place.

Now you’re ready to install the motherboard into the case. Before placing it inside, install the I/O shield (the rectangular metal plate that came with the motherboard) into the back of the case. It snaps into place from inside. Make sure it is oriented correctly. Next, install the motherboard standoffs into the case if they aren’t already installed. These are small brass spacers that screw into the case and match the hole pattern of your motherboard. Use the motherboard to identify where the holes should go, and screw the standoffs into place. Lower the motherboard gently into the case, aligning it with the I/O shield and standoffs. Once aligned, use the screws provided to secure the motherboard to the standoffs. Do not overtighten.

Install your storage devices next. If you are using a 2.5" SSD or a 3.5" hard drive, insert them into the appropriate drive bays in the case. Many modern cases have tool-less trays or mounting points. If needed, screw them in securely. If you’re using an M.2 SSD, it mounts directly to the motherboard. Locate the M.2 slot, remove the small screw near it, insert the SSD at a 30-degree angle, and then secure it with the screw. Connect SATA data cables from your SATA drives to the motherboard’s SATA ports, and SATA power cables from the power supply to the drives.

Now, install the graphics card if you have one. Locate the appropriate PCIe x16 slot on the motherboard (usually the top one closest to the CPU). Remove the corresponding expansion slot covers on the case’s rear panel. Insert the GPU into the slot, pressing firmly until it clicks into place and the latch at the end of the PCIe slot locks. Secure the GPU to the case using the screws that held the slot covers. If the GPU requires power, connect the appropriate PCIe power cables from the power supply.

Connect the power supply cables next. Connect the 24-pin main power cable to the motherboard. Connect the 8-pin (sometimes 4+4) CPU power cable near the top of the motherboard. Connect SATA power cables to storage drives and PCIe cables to the GPU if needed. Ensure all cables are plugged in securely.

Now connect the front panel connectors. These are small connectors that control the power button, reset button, HDD LED, power LED, and possibly front USB and audio ports. Refer to the motherboard manual for the exact pin layout. Carefully plug each connector into the correct pins. These can be a bit fiddly, so take your time. Also connect USB 3.0, USB-C, and front audio connectors to the corresponding headers on the motherboard.

Install any additional case fans or cooling components. Most fans connect via 3-pin or 4-pin connectors to the motherboard or to a fan controller. Position fans for optimal airflow: typically, intake fans in the front or bottom and exhaust fans in the rear or top. Make sure airflow direction is consistent.

With all components installed and cables connected, it’s a good time to check cable management. Use cable ties to bundle cables neatly and route them behind the motherboard tray if your case allows. This improves airflow and aesthetics.

Before closing the case, do a final check to ensure all components are installed correctly, all cables are secure, RAM and GPU are seated properly, CPU cooler is mounted, and nothing is loose. Connect a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Plug in the power supply and turn it on using the switch on the PSU. Press the power button on the case. If all is well, the system will power on, fans will spin, and the motherboard will POST (Power On Self Test), often showing a logo or boot message on screen.

If nothing happens, check power connections, front panel connectors, and reseat components. If the system powers on but you get no display, check GPU, monitor connection, and RAM placement.

If it boots properly, enter the BIOS by pressing the indicated key (often Delete, F2, or Esc) on startup. Check that your CPU, RAM, and storage devices are detected. Set boot priority to your installation media if you're installing an operating system.

Close the case panels, secure them with screws, and position the computer where you intend to use it. Plug in peripherals, network cable or Wi-Fi antenna, and power. Insert your OS installation media (USB or DVD), reboot the machine, and follow the prompts to install your operating system.

Once the OS is installed, install drivers for your motherboard chipset, GPU, network adapter, and audio. These can be found on the manufacturer’s website or included discs. Update the operating system, install antivirus and any other needed software.

Congratulations—you have built your own computer from scratch.
